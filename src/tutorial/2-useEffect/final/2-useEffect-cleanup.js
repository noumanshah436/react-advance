1) first time we render the component , useEffect run after that and it add eventListener to window ( but cleanup will not run at that time )
2) If the added event occer and checkSize function is caled and we call setSize in it

3) SetSize will re-render the component .
	However before it run the UseEffect after that render, It will run the cleanup function first and 
	then the body of UseEffect will run afetr cleanup function.

when we set up only initial render in useEffect by passing [] , it solve the problem of setting tons of event listeners each time we call useEffect ,
and  now useEffect will only once and  for that case cleanup will only run at the end when component is removed from the DOM .
